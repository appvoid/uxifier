# uxifier
A library DOM to create modern UI.

Write beautiful we components from JavaScript. As simple as that ðŸ˜€


### But, why would I like to mix DOM and Styles with JavaScript, it's bad practice!
Well, this library is not meant for real projects (yet), but projects that doesn't require too much complexity to achieve.
Think of it like a lightweight version of BootStrap completely made using Vanilla JS.

How does it work?
