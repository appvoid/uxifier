# uxifier
A library to create modern UI  the easy way.

Write beautiful we components from JavaScript.
As simple as that ðŸ˜€


### But, why would I like to mix DOM and Styles with JavaScript, it's bad practice!
Well, this library is not meant for real projects (yet), but projects that doesn't require too much complexity to achieve.
Think of it like a lightweight version of BootStrap made completely with Vanilla JS.
